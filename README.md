## Task


I was tasked to refactor an existing webpage to meet a web accessibility standard. This is to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies. In particular, I was provided with the following user story and acceptance criteria.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

### Preview

The end product should resemble the mock-up provided below:
